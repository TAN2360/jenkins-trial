# 🐳 Jenkins Trial Project

A mini DevOps experiment to connect the dots between terminal scripting, GitHub, and Jenkins CI — all powered by Docker.

## 🔧 What This Project Does

- Creates a basic shell script (`script.sh`)
- Pushes code to GitHub from terminal
- Runs the script via a Jenkins pipeline hosted in Docker
- Uses a `Jenkinsfile` to define stages and build logic

## 📂 Repo Contents

- `script.sh` – Bash script executed by Jenkins
- `Jenkinsfile` – Declarative pipeline used in Jenkins
- `README.md` – This file 🙌

## 🚀 Tools & Tech

- Git + GitHub
- Jenkins (via Docker)
- Bash
- WSL (Ubuntu)
- Docker Compose

## ✅ Goals Achieved

- Set up Jenkins in a local container
- Created a functional pipeline from scratch
- Successfully pulled and built a repo from GitHub

## 🌱 Next Steps

- Add real application logic (e.g., Python or Node.js)
- Integrate test cases or linters
- Automate builds with GitHub webhooks
